![Rain](https://media1.tenor.com/images/735e68b36fb24b5cadda815230daad05/tenor.gif?itemid=13649339)
- Predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not.
- The dataset contains 2008 - 2017 (10 years) of Australian weather data.
- Used 6 models and parameters tuning to predict.
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
    - K Nearest Neighbors
    - Support Vector Machine
    - Naive Bayes
- Compare accuracy score, f1 score, precision score and recall score for each model.
